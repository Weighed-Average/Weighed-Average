## About ME

**Weighed-Average/Weighed-Average** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently learning STAT(Undergraduate) in CUHK, Shenzhen.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in sociology. Thus, I wish I could study on computational sociology at my master's level.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on learning coding as a greenhand!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding how to generate a program with typical functions. I mean, the whole process of thinking.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: curious and deeply reliant on intuition
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm BOTH shy AND full of ingenious ideas, mainly reflected in the way I ask... Don't be scared!
